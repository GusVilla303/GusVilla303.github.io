**Overview**

I really enjoyed working on this CLI Scraper project! There were several challenges I dealt with along the way but overall it was a great learning experience. 

My first challenge was coming up with a web site to scrape since there are so many options; therefore, I narrowed my search by scraping a site that I found interesting. I wanted to build a scraper that I, personally, would use on a daily basis, so I went with National Public Radio's (NPR) news web site.  

The next major deciding point was to determine *what* data I should present to the user and *how* to do so. There were several stories on NPR's main (index) news page, but I wanted to keep things simple, so I opted to only render the **featured** stories, which included the top three articles. Next, in favor of a better user-experience, I decided that instead of rendering the content of each individual story into my CLI, I instead chose to enable the user to read the story in his/her browser. This would keep the formatting of the content much simpler and cleaner for both me and the user. 

In terms of coding, I really made an effort to use strong Object Oriented Programming principles by implementing SRP and DRY. I am really making an effort to separate concerns by creating individual objects that collaborate with eachother instead of clustering excessive business logic in only one or two models. Though there are a few areas that could use improvement, overall, I am fairly content with my final code. Throughout this first module with Flatiron, I can certainly attest that my OOP skills have improved significantly. 

I look forward to continiuing to level up skills with each lab and module! Until next time!
